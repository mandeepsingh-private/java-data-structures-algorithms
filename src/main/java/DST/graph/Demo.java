Imagine that you need to represent the Facebook network as a graph.
You would have to create a matrix of 2 billion x 2 billion,
where most of it would be empty! Nobody would know everybody else,
just a few thousand at most.

In general, we deal with sparse graphs so that the matrix will waste a lot of
space. Thatâ€™s why, in most implementations, we would use an adjacency list
rather than the matrix.
